# 🧑‍🏫 Level 3 Python Activity: Personal Data Manager

Complete or add yopur code into the main.py of the repository.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Apply input/output, string formatting, and data structures in a real-world scenario.
- Practice problem decomposition and modular thinking.
- Use functions to organize code and improve readability.

## 🧠 Scenario
You will build a **Personal Data Manager** that allows users to:
- Enter personal details (name, age, hobbies).
- Store hobbies in a list.
- Store user data in a dictionary.
- Display the information using formatted strings.
- Use a set to ensure hobbies are unique.
- Use a tuple to store fixed data (e.g., birth year and current year).

## 🧪 Task Breakdown
1. Collect user info (name and age).
2. Collect hobbies using a loop.
3. Store the data in a dictionary.
4. Display the data using formatted strings.
5. Use a set to ensure hobbies are unique.
6. Use a tuple to store birth year and current year.

## 💬 Reflection Questions
- Why might we use a set instead of a list for hobbies?
- What are the benefits of using a dictionary to store user data?
- How does tuple unpacking help us work with fixed data?

## 🧩 Extension Challenge (Optional)
Add a function that:
- Takes the dictionary as input.
- Returns a formatted summary of the user.

Use this challenge to practice writing reusable code and improve your understanding of functions.
